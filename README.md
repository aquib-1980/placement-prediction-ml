# 🎓 Placement Prediction using Machine Learning  
*A beginner-friendly ML project to predict student placements using Python & Scikit-learn.*

 📖 Project Overview  
This project uses a placement dataset (`placement.csv`) to predict whether a student will get placed or not** based on their academic performance and other features.  

It is an end-to-end ML workflow covering:  
- Data exploration  
- Preprocessing  
- Model building  
- Evaluation and visualization  



 📂 Dataset  
- File: `placement.csv`  
- Features include: CGPA, IQ, and other attributes  
- Target Variable: `status` → Placed / Not Placed  



   🔍 Steps in the Project  
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
   - Checked dataset shape, null values, and distributions  
   - Visualized placement trends  

     Data Preprocessing:  
   - Encoded categorical values  
   - Scaled features  

   Model Building: 
   - Applied ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
   - Compared results  

   Evaluation:  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Visualization of predictions  

 📊 Results  
- Best Model Accuracy: `90%`  
- Key Insight: Higher CGPA and IQ strongly increase placement chances.  

 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
